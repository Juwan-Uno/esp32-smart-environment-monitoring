# esp32-smart-environment-monitoring
This project utilizes multiple sensors (DHT11, IR, sound, and rain sensors) to monitor environmental conditions in real time. The ESP32 operates in WiFi Access Point mode and hosts a web-based dashboard that can be accessed via a smartphone or any WiFi-enabled device without requiring an external internet connection.
